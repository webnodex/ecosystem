# Coding Standards

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices to be followed across all WebNodeX projects within this ecosystem. Adhering to these standards ensures consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.

## General Principles

- **Clarity over Brevity**: Write code that is easy to understand.
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and styles within the project.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid redundant code by abstracting common functionalities.

## Language Specific Standards

// TODO: Add sections for specific languages like TypeScript, JavaScript, etc. if applicable

## Linting and Formatting

// TODO: Specify linters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) and their configurations

## Commit Messages

We adhere to the Conventional Commits specification for writing clear and descriptive commit messages. This practice helps in automating changelog generation and understanding project history.
